Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject:
- Comments
- Commits
- Code

that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Contributors

Contributors are expected to:
- Follow this Code of Conduct in all project spaces
- Report unacceptable behavior to project maintainers
- Accept accountability for their actions
- Demonstrate respect and professionalism

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- **Project Spaces**: GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, wiki
- **Communication Channels**: Any official communication (Discord, Slack, email, etc.)
- **Public Representation**: When representing the project at events, social media, or other venues
- **Private Communication**: When discussing project-related matters

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers:

- **Email**: [Create a project email or use maintainer email]
- **GitHub**: Private message to @xWael9
- **Anonymous**: [Set up anonymous reporting form if needed]

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Confidentiality will be maintained regarding the reporter of an incident.

### Investigation Process

1. **Receipt**: Maintainers acknowledge receipt of report within 24 hours
2. **Review**: Maintainers review the incident and gather necessary information
3. **Decision**: Maintainers determine appropriate response
4. **Action**: Implement decided course of action
5. **Follow-up**: Check in with all parties involved

### Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines when determining consequences:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Minor inappropriate language or behavior.

**Consequence**: Private written warning from maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: Violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: Warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in project spaces and external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: Serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: Temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation, sustained harassment, or aggression toward individuals or classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: Permanent ban from any public interaction within the project community.

## Examples in Practice

### Good Examples

**Scenario 1**: A contributor submits a PR with poor code quality.
- ✅ **Response**: "Thank you for the contribution! I have some suggestions to improve code quality. [Specific feedback]. Would you like help implementing these changes?"

**Scenario 2**: Disagreement on architectural approach.
- ✅ **Response**: "I see your point about using Approach A. My concern is [specific concern]. Could we discuss the tradeoffs? Perhaps we could document both approaches and decide together."

**Scenario 3**: Bug report with insufficient information.
- ✅ **Response**: "Thanks for the report! To help debug this, could you provide: 1) macOS version, 2) steps to reproduce, 3) console logs? Here's a template to make it easier: [link]"

### Bad Examples

**Scenario 1**: Poor code quality PR.
- ❌ **Response**: "This code is terrible. Did you even test it? Read the docs before submitting."

**Scenario 2**: Architectural disagreement.
- ❌ **Response**: "That's the stupidest approach I've ever seen. Anyone with experience would know better."

**Scenario 3**: Bug report.
- ❌ **Response**: "Works fine for me. User error. RTFM."
